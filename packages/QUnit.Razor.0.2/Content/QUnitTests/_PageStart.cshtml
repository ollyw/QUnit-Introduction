@* QUnit-Razor NuGet package v0.2
 * http://www.nuget.org/packages/QUnit.Razor
 *
 * Adds QUnit js/css to ASP.NET MVC Razor projects and Cshtml Test Runner web page to /QUnitTests/index.cshtml.
 * Just put your tests into js files in /QUnitTests folder. The test runner scans for all of them.
 * Feel free to rename QUnitTests testing folder to anything you like.
 *
 * Please send any suggestions to improve that package and the runner.
