# QUnit Introduction #

This project aims to give a quick tour of the various features of the QUnit test runner for javascript. It covers some basic and some more obscure functionality. It does not cover how unit testing theory or TDD.

## Getting started ##
There are three ways to run the project, dependent on which tool you prefer to use:

### Using ASP.Net/IIS ###
If you use Visual Studio with ASP.MVC 3.0 installed, you can simply run the project. Please make sure you run Visual Studio with Administrator permissions the first time to enable the website to be created

### Using Resharper ###
The project has been designed so the QUnit tests can be run in Resharper 6.1 and up using the built in support.

### Using the static web page ###
If you don't want to use Visual Studio, there is a static web page that can be run directly in a browser. The file is Content/Static.html. Please be aware that browsers will cache local files unless explicitly disabled, so changes you make to javascript files might not take affect.
